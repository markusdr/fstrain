This directory is for code that *creates* finite-state machines (from
data, etc.). The code may use core/ and util/, but must not use
train/.

Here is how a scoring machine with backoff is created:

create+train-r-interface.cc: Calls CreateNgramFstFromBestAlign with
backoff_tlm_fct

create-ngram-fst-from-best-align.h: 1. Creates ngram trie T from
aligned data, 2. creates a backoff model M1 using the
backoff_syms_fct, 3. Converts T to model FSA M0
(create-scoring-fst-from-trie.h), 4. intersects M0 and M1, converts to
transducer
